# Patient Information System

The Patient Information System is a simple console application written in C# that allows users to enter their age and patient information, such as first name, last name, weight, and height. The system calculates and displays the patient's blood pressure, BMI (Body Mass Index), and BMI status.

## Prerequisites

To run the Patient Information System, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Microsoft .NET Framework
- C# compiler

## Getting Started

To get started with the Patient Information System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open the source code files in a C# development environment or text editor.
3. Compile the code to generate the executable file.
4. Run the executable file.

## Usage

1. When prompted, enter your age.
2. Provide the patient's information as requested (first name, last name, weight in KG, and height in centimeters).
3. The system will calculate the patient's blood pressure based on example values for systolic and diastolic pressure.
4. The system will calculate the patient's BMI (Body Mass Index) based on the provided weight and height.
5. The patient's information, including blood pressure, BMI, and BMI status, will be displayed.

Note: You can customize the example values for systolic and diastolic pressure to obtain accurate blood pressure readings.

## Example

```
Enter your age:
30

Enter patient information:
First Name: John
Last Name: Doe
Weight (in KG): 75
Height (in Centimeters): 180
